With Amazon DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data and serve any level of request traffic. You use an Amazon DynamoDB table to store data for your API. Each item has a unique ID, which we use as the partition key for the table. To create a DynamoDB table: 1. Open the DynamoDB console at `https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/` 2. Choose `Create table`. 3. For `Table name`, enter `http-crud-tutorial-items`. 4. For `Primary key`, enter `id`. 5.
